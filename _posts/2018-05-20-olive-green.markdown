## Olive green smokey eye!!

Hi my loves! Today I have a fun olive green smokey eye for you!! I was debating what colors to use today and the greens were speaking to me. I’ve been dying to try the new Subculture palette ever since I got it. I saw a ton of negative feedback on the palette so I wanted to give it a try. I used it as I would any other palette and I actually really love how this look came out. I ALWAYS lightly dip my brushes once or twice into shadows and build as I go. Maybe I got lucky and got a good one but so far so good. What did you think of this look!? Have you guys tried out this palette? Do you love it or hate it? The color scheme is just so beautiful I couldn’t resist. XOXO Carli

*I was just informed Sephora brand isn’t actually cruelty free. This is news to me.. honest mistake 🙁 Won’t be using them in the future!!!!
